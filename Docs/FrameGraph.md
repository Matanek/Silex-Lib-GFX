# GFX.FrameGraph

`GFX.FrameGraph` describes logical resources, passes, their access, and their
dependencies. The graph is public: an alternative renderer can build and
compile it, inspect its plan, and share transient resources whose lifetimes do
not overlap.

```silex
use GFX.FrameGraph

var graph = FrameGraph()
let scene = graph.add_pass("Alternative.Scene")
let overlay = graph.add_pass("Application.Overlay")
graph.depends(overlay, scene)
graph.require_compiled()
```

Pass names express their logical owner. An explicit dependency can order
passes registered by several extensions without granting access to each
other's private resources.
